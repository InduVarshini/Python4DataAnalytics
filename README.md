Machine learning algorithms implemented using sci-kit learn.

This tutorial helps in understanding the Python programming from basics. 
Later you can learn the basics of Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib before jumping into the machine learning part.

We use Sci-kit learn package to implement the basic machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression and k-means clustering on various
datasets.
